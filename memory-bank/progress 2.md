## Known Issues & Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **Rate Limiting:** Need to implement proper delays for web scraping
2. **Data Volume:** High-frequency price data storage optimization required
3. **Concurrent Processing:** Thread safety for multiple data sources
4. **External Dependencies:** Robust error handling for site changes
5. **Real-time Performance:** <30 second delivery requirement

### Business Logic Complexity
1. **Signal Accuracy:** Balancing false positives vs missed opportunities
2. **Risk Management:** User-specific parameter configuration
3. **Performance Tracking:** Accurate intraday P&L calculation
4. **Subscription Model:** Fair usage and feature access control

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Technology Choices
- **Django:** Selected for rapid development and built-in admin interface
- **PostgreSQL:** Chosen for financial data reliability and time-series performance
- **Celery + Redis:** Preferred over Django-crontab for scalable background processing
- **Selenium:** Required for JavaScript-heavy stooq.pl site scraping

### Architecture Evolution
- **Feature-sliced:** Chosen over traditional layered architecture for better maintainability
- **Event-driven:** Added for real-time notification requirements
- **Repository Pattern:** Included for clean data access abstraction
- **Strategy Pattern:** Selected for pluggable indicator system

### Development Approach
- **Docker-first:** Ensures consistent development and deployment environments
- **Test-driven:** Comprehensive testing strategy for financial accuracy
- **Environment-based:** Configuration management for multiple deployment stages

## Success Metrics & KPIs

### Technical Performance
- **System Uptime:** Target >99% during trading hours
- **Notification Speed:** <30 seconds from signal generation
- **Data Accuracy:** 100% reliable price data collection
- **Concurrent Users:** Support for growing subscriber base

### Business Metrics
- **Signal Accuracy:** Target >70% profitable recommendations
- **User Engagement:** Daily active usage during trading hours
- **Subscription Retention:** Monitor renewal rates
- **Revenue Growth:** Track subscription model viability

## Current Priorities
1. **Immediate:** Complete Django project setup and basic structure
2. **Short-term:** Implement core scraping and analysis functionality
3. **Medium-term:** Add user management and Telegram integration
4. **Long-term:** Optimize performance and add advanced features

The project is in its initial phase with strong foundational planning completed. Next steps focus on translating the architectural design into working Django applications.
